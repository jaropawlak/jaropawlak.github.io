      <description>Apps on iOS are nice, Xcode is fine development environment and working in it is fun. I have and app on iOS which I would like to port also to Android. I thought about rewriting it in Xamarin.Forms.
It turned out Xamarin apps (now as a part of Visual Studio) are also nice to write. I choose Xamarin.Forms to minimize code needed per platform. App is available on github: https://github.com/jaropawlak/MyExpenses.Xamarin and has almost all functionality my original app had.</description>

      <title>Coredata With Cloudkit</title>

      <description>With iOS 13 we&amp;rsquo;ll get new cool feature - coredata db with cloudkit backup. Exactly what I need.
Bad news is that my old device will not get the update.
My doctor said that I should track food I eat. What I should do is divide my day into 2-3 hour windows and eat a small meal in every one of them. And write it down and then show it to the doctor so we can talk about what I should and what I should not eat.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer working with .NET Framework for more then 15 years now. I remember version 1.0 and have worked with all versions. I also write software for iOS. And desktop apps.
And console apps.
And webapps in other technologies.
And other stuff :)
My first computer was ATARI 65XE with BASIC interpreter on board. I was 7 years old. I was hooked with first line of code which might have looked like this:</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Jaroslaw and this is my first post.
Usually, beginning learning new programming language starts with &amp;ldquo;Hello, World&amp;rdquo; application, therefore I&amp;rsquo;ll start with Hello World post.
This blog is generated with hugo content generator and is hosted as a github page. I&amp;rsquo;m using automatic deployment, setup can be found here: https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/. If you see it, it means it worked like a charm ;).
Well then&amp;hellip;
Hello, World</description>
