      <description>C# is a great language. Each new version takes best solutions from other languages and keeps it very modern. However writing C# all the time both at work and at home feels boring sometimes. I like learning new languages as this provides good exercise. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a simple go program. And because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a better idea I took an app that I had already written in .</description>

      <description>Apps on iOS are nice, Xcode is fine development environment and working in it is fun. I have and app on iOS which I would like to port also to Android. I thought about rewriting it in Xamarin.Forms.
It turned out Xamarin apps (now as a part of Visual Studio) are also nice to write. I choose Xamarin.Forms to minimize code needed per platform. App is available on github: https://github.com/jaropawlak/MyExpenses.Xamarin and has almost all functionality my original app had.</description>

      <description>With iOS 13 we&amp;rsquo;ll get new cool feature - coredata db with cloudkit backup. Exactly what I need.
Bad news is that my old device will not get the update.
My doctor said that I should track food I eat. What I should do is divide my day into 2-3 hour windows and eat a small meal in every one of them. And write it down and then show it to the doctor so we can talk about what I should and what I should not eat.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Jaroslaw and this is my first post.
Usually, beginning learning new programming language starts with &amp;ldquo;Hello, World&amp;rdquo; application, therefore I&amp;rsquo;ll start with Hello World post.
This blog is generated with hugo content generator and is hosted as a github page. I&amp;rsquo;m using automatic deployment, setup can be found here: https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/. If you see it, it means it worked like a charm ;).
Well then&amp;hellip;
Hello, World</description>
