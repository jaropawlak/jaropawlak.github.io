      <description>Apps on iOS are nice, Xcode is fine development environment and working in it is fun. I have and app on iOS which I would like to port also to Android. I thought about rewriting it in Xamarin.Forms.
It turned out Xamarin apps (now as a part of Visual Studio) are also nice to write. I choose Xamarin.Forms to minimize code needed per platform. App is available on github: https://github.com/jaropawlak/MyExpenses.Xamarin and has almost all functionality my original app had.</description>
